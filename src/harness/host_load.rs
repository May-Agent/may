//! Alerts for high machine load.
//!
//! A [`HostLoadMonitor`] reads the host through a [`HostReader`] and turns
//! sustained machine load into events: the load *starts* when it stays
//! above its threshold for the start window, and *ends* when it stays below
//! for the end window, so a brief spike does not flap.
//!
//! Machine load, memory pressure and disk pressure reach the model as state
//! ([`HostConditions`]): as a request is assembled, and only
//! when a condition's level differs from the one the model last saw, so a
//! condition that rises and settles while the agent is idle says nothing.
//! A final memory warning and a kill are events, each told once.
//!
//! While high load lasts, the monitor also lengthens the terminal's
//! foreground window, because commands slowed by the load would otherwise
//! outlast the normal one and move to the background.
//!
//! The monitor never kills or pauses anything.
